What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets up a tracking system to track changes between files. It can't look back into what happened before, it can only start tracking what we have right now.

Why would I use two commits?
Because lesson one and lesson two are logically separate.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the part of your working directory that you would like to save/commit. It offers you the opportunity to commit modular changes, rather than having to save the entire working directory at once.
